<h2>ACQUISITION</h2>
<p>
    Press the “Acquire” button to start the image acquisition.
</p>
<h3>Using the Anti-drift option</h3>
<p>
    To use the implemented Anti-drift function during image acquisition, tick “Anti-Drift”. As soon as the “Acquire” button is pressed the plugin will ask you to select the channel used by the Anti-drift function.
    The compensational changes of the stage can be looked up in the Anti-Drift logs tab.
    Note that the Anti-drift logic uses the PhaseCorrelation source code created by Stephan Preibisch and therefore works in x, y, and z.
