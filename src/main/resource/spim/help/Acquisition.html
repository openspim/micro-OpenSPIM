<h2>Acquisition</h2>
<p>
    After all positions and number of time points have been specified, it's almost time to start imaging. However, there are still a few options worth considering before starting the acquisition process such as ROI, Anti-Drift and Binning. It's also worth checking one more time if the correct saving format has been chosen and whether Maximum Intensity Projections should be generated on the fly.
</p>
<h3>Anti-Drift</h3>
<p>
    Click the Anti-drift tab to enable it with the aim to prevent the sample from leaving its initial predefined position. One can choose between Phase Correlation (whereby entire volume of a 3d-stack is taken into account) or Centre of Mass (whereby drifts are only corrected in x, y but not in z). Note that high concentrations of fluorescent beads surrounding the sample may disarrange the Anti-Drift functionality.
</p>
<h3>Binning</h3>
<p>
    Different binning options can be selected before acquisition, e.g. <b>2x2</b> or <b>3x3</b> binning. Higher Binning settings combines the charge of more pixels, which increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and results in higher camera frame rates but on the expanse of pixel resolution.
</p>
<h3>On-the-fly</h3>
<p>
    On-the-fly will enable the “process()” method of a running script, which can be created or edited within the Java Editor (Editor > Java).
</p>
<h3>Ablation</h3>
<p>
    This is an experimental option to generate next to the acquired image(s) an additional single image slice or stack. The name of this additional file will end with "_ablation.tiff". This option works only with OMETIFF as saving format.
</p>
<h3>ROI</h3>
<p>
    Within this tab a region of interest (ROI) can be specified and applied to the field of view of the camera. The region is specified in the preview window of µManager. Select the Rectangle tool and create a selection inside the preview window. The window will open up by clicking Live view. When the ROI is specified, click the <span style="color: dodgerblue">Apply</span> button.
</p>
<h3 style="color: dodgerblue">Live</h3>
<p>
    Clicking this button will toggle the camera into live view. The exposure values can be changed below.
</p>
<h3 style="color: dodgerblue">Acquire</h3>
<p>
    Clicking this button will start the currently set up imaging session.
