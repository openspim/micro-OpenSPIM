<h2>Time points</h2>
<p>
    This table includes the information how often the predefined positions should be acquired. A time point can be specified once or many times for long term time lapse recordings. In case 3-d stacks are acquired across a given period of time, the imaging process is referred to as 4d-Microscopy.
