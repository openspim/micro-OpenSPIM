<h2>Stage</h2>
<p>
    Here you can move the four stepper motors of the 4D-stage Stages (X, Y, Z, R), calibrate the rotational stepper size (R Stage), save and load current positions and inverse the axis of the x and y stage, which might be crucial for the Anti-Drift to work correctly.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Save current position</dt>
    <dd>Click this button to save the current position of the stage. It will be added to a list.</dd>

    <dt>Load location</dt>
    <dd>Click this button to Load a previously saved stage position from a list.</dd>

    <dt style="color: black">Indicate angles</dt>
    <dd>Indicate here the number of angles you wish to acquire during a single time-point. The angles will then be indicated above the rotational stage (Stage R).
        <li>Click <span style="color: dodgerblue">Homing</span> on one of the four Stages to move the stepper motor back to its home position.
        <li>Click <span style="color: dodgerblue">Stop</span> to immediately stop a stepper motor.
    </dd>

    <dt>Calibrate</dt>
    <dd>
        Click this button to calibrate the R Stage in case the 360 degrees do not correspond to a full revolution of the sample holder.
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Add Pos.
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Clicking this button will add a row to the end of the Position table using the current X, Y, Z and R coordinates.
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Go back to the last used position
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Clicking this button will move the stage to the previous position.
