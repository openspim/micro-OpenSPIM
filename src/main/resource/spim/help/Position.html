<h2>POSITIONS</h2>
<h3>Adding multiple positions</h3>
<p>
    The viewer can display files containing multiple sources.
    For example, in a multi-angle SPIM sequence, each angle is a source.
</p>
<h3>Adding multiple angles</h3>
<p>
    In case multiple angles should be acquired, we recommend to verify if the R stage completes a full revolution. If the 360 degrees don’t correspond to a full revolution, press the “Calibrate” button below the R Stage and correct for the deviation. Follow the help instructions in the new window if needed.
</p>
<h3>Deleting created entries</h3>
<p>
    Select any previously created position from the list and then press the “Delete position” button to remove the entry.
</p>
<h3>Changing/Updating positional values</h3>
<p>
    It is possible to manually change any positional values by double-clicking on one of the positional entries. Note that this can be done during an ongoing imaging session.
    In order to overwrite all positional values with the current positions of the stepper motors simply select any previously created position entry and press the “Update position” button. Every time such changes are applied, the plugin will ask for confirmation of the changes.

</p>
<h3>Changing the order of created entries</h3>
<p>
    The order of the list can be changed via drag and drop.
