<h2>DEFINE Z-STACKS</h2>
<p>
    To define a new z-stack, first find and centre your sample and then use the Z stage to navigate through its volume along the detection axis until you reach the starting point of your sample. Lock this z position (the beginning of a new stack) by pressing the “Z-start” button. Then navigate in z through to your sample and press the “Z-end” button where the stack is intended to finish. In this way a 3-dimensional stack is specified.
    The z-values will appear next to the buttons once the beginning or the end of a z-stack has been specified.
    It is recommended to add extra slices before and after the end of your volume of interest.
