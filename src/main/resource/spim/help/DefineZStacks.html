<h2>Define Z-stacks</h2>
<p>
    Here the beginning and the end of a new stack together with its Z step size can be specified using the Z stage. One has to first find the sample and a centre it in the field of view. By navigating through the sample along the z-axis the beginning and end of a z-stack is specified.
</p>


<dl>
    <dt>Z-start</dt>
    <dd>Clicking this button will mark the current z stepper motor position as the beginning of a desired z-stack.</dd>

    <dt>Z-end</dt>
    <dd>Clicking this button will mark the current z stepper motor position as the end of a desired z-stack.</dd>

    <dt>Go to centre</dt>
    <dd>Clicking this button will move the stage Z into the centre of the defined z-stack.</dd>

    <dt>Add Z-stack</dt>
    <dd>Clicking this button will add a row to the end of the positions table that will include the X, Y, and R positions together with the two z-stack positions (Z-start and Z-end) and the Z step size value.</dd>

    <dd><li>It is possible to manually change any positional values by double-clicking on one of the positional entries. Note that this can be done during an ongoing imaging session.</dd>


    <dt>New Z-stack</dt>
    <dd>Clicking this button will clear all previously locked Z-stack values in order to define a new Z-stack.</dd>

    <dd><li>It is possible to manually change any positional values by double-clicking on one of the positional entries. Note that this can be done during an ongoing imaging session.</dd>

</dl>

<p>
    In order to overwrite all positional values with the current positions of the stepper motors simply select any previously created position entry and press the “Update position” button.
