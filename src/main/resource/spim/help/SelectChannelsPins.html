<h2>Channels</h2>
<p>
    A typical channel is a laser of a given wavelength illuminating the sample during acquisition. In case an Arduino UNO is in control of one or several lasers, they all must be wired to one of the digital output pins. It is possible that a channel represents a different device other than a laser. Alternatively, lasers can also be controlled by the Software, which in our case is ÂµManager. Do find out more about Software versus Hardware controlled imaging, click <a href="https://openspim.org/micro-openspim_softwarevshardware" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Software controlled</h3>
<p>
    Click <span style="color: dodgerblue"><b>Add channel</b></span> to add a new channel to the table. Several channels can be added to the table.
    <ul>
        <li>Click into the drop-down menus to change Camera and the correct Shutter for the intended laser line.
        <li>Double click on the exposure value of any added channel to change it.
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Arduino Controlled</h3>
<p>
    Simply select one or several of the available channels (<b>Pin8</b> to <b>Pin13</b>) that are under the control of the Arduino-Shutter. Channel Names can be changed in the Arduino UNO configuration table.
    <ul>
        <li>Double click on the exposure value of any added channel to change it.
    </ul>
